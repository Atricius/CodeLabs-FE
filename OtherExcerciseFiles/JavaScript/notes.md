    Values
    The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
        Fixed values - called Literals
            Numbers
            Strings
        Variable values - called Variables to store data values
            JavaScript uses the keywords 'var', 'let' and 'const' to declare variables.
            An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

    Operators
        JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values.
        JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

    Experssions
        An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
